VMouse_Abstraction:
The virtual mouse project is a software
application that allows users to control
their computer using hand gestures 
captured by a webcam. The software 
utilizes computer vision algorithms to 
track the movement of the user's hand and
translate it into cursor movement on 
the screen. The project aims to provide 
a more natural and intuitive way of 
interacting with the computer, eliminating
 the need for a physical mouse. 
Additionally, the virtual mouse can be 
used by individuals with disabilities who 
may have difficulty using traditional 
input devices. The project is implemented 
using a combination of programming 
languages such as C++ and Python, as well 
as open-source libraries such as OpenCV 
and PyAutoGUI. Overall, the virtual mouse 
project is a unique and innovative 
solution that aims to enhance the user 
experience of interacting with a computer.
